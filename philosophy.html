	<center><h1>PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY</h1></center>
<br><br>

<h2>Celebrate</h2>

<p>Celebration isn't just about pizza parties after a milestone or an award after a success. Celebration comes from gratitude&mdash;they are two sides of the same coin. Gratitude's natural expression is celebration. When my son eats something he really likes he starts to do a happy dance waving his little hands. One year olds naturally celebrate, it's important for us as adults to do so also. Whether it's a high five, a note of thanks, or a huddle recognition, celebration is more than about thanks. I believe it to be an essential component towards creating a culture of harmony and comradery.</p>

<h2>Consideration</h2>

<p>Consideration is keeping the ideal that we work with human beings and our relationships while conducting business are great treasures. Even in IT, the wise speak every word with consideration instead of treating communication as flat information exchange. We never know when our consideration may create a relationship that will last an entire career. To be willing to listen, to say a thank you for a small help, to greet someone in an email before getting down to business&mdash;these are signs of consideration. One may think, "Why should I be so considerate, I will not receive it in return." Do it anyway, be persistent, because being considerate is a gift in itself.</p>

<h2>Create what you Love</h2>

<p>Don't let yourself be constrained by self-limiting beliefs&mdash;create what you love! If you enjoy learning, teach. If you love people, talk to customers. There is no shortage of potential within the mission and culture of an organization. I have found this to be the case from startup environments all the way to large public agencies. There is <a href="http://appliedpsychologydegree.usc.edu/resources/articles/how-liking-your-job-will-help-you-succeed/">research</a> which links top performance with happiness and I think it is reasonable to assume people who are happy at work create what they love. I love to build that which has not been done before. That's what attracted me to financial IT systems that cannot lose a penny and to implementing the original Affordable Care Act. This also attracted me to implementing public cloud at a market leader.</p>

<h2>Alignment</h2>

<p>To be aligned in a company is to be connected to the whole and to the mission of the organization. Ultimately this is tracing back how our own role helps the company provide a product or service that is successful in the market place. For me alignment is an attunement constantly receiving the signal or pulse from the core of the company&mdash;its customers, its values, and its leaders. This is a very different philosophy from one of rank-and-file where each staff member performs the work dictated by their direct superior. By approaching our contributions from a standpoint of how it aligns with the company, at times management may even be unaware of tasks needed to be performed because we expand our outlook and purpose. Alignment is how staff members progress from the paradigm of receiving direction from their manager to the paradigm of updating their manager on how they are adding value to the organization.</p>

<h2>One for All, and All for One</h2>
<p>We are each a completely unique member of a whole when we are at a company. Some synonyms to company are <i>companionship</i> and <i>friendship</i> which point to a deeper meaning than a commercial entity. Every individual has a unique and valuable perspective to contribute. I think there are as many opinions about a company as the number of people working there&mdash;from each member you will get a different view into the whole. And yet the company has its own sort of culture or personality. For example, Tesla has a very different company culture from Coca-Cola. We are the microcosm in the macrocosm. Each member of the company represents the whole and the whole supports each individual member. In our daily work it is of paramount importance to think about the greater whole when we make decisions (One for All) but it is just as important to accept the diverse rainbow of opinions that makeup the whole (All for One).</p>

<h2>Become the Solution</h2>
<p>In this day in age of rapid technology growth it is easy to become cynical and lose Heart. When we are faced with life's problems the skill is to move past the "complaint" and look toward the solution. Sometimes we must even become the solution.</p>
