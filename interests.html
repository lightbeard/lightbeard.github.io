	<h1>INTERESTS</h1>
	
	<p>Besides the obvious interest in programming which is easily gauged by how over-engineered this website is, below are some of my other interests.</p>
	
	<h2>Meditation</h2>
	<p><img class="icon" src="img/meditation.jpg">I've had a daily meditation practice for 4 years and have been instructing introductory meditation for about 2 years. I have interest and continue to explore a number of meditation traditions; however, my primary practice is in <a href="http://iamheart.org">Heart-Rhythm Meditation</a> and <a href="http://www.contemplativeoutreach.org/">Centering Prayer</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>Chess</h2>
	<p><img class="icon" src="img/chess.jpg">I've always enjoyed a casual game of chess. From time to time I work on my chess game and have steadily improved to about a 1650 UCI rating. I like to play unconventional openings often discovered with my <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chess-opening-explorer/id1065272342?ls=1&mt=8">own chess app</a>. I think my finest chess games have been against my neice who learned how to play chess with me when she was 4 years old ;)</p>
	
	<h2>Sailing</h2>
	<p><img class="icon" src="img/sailing.jpg">I take particular interest in sailing in honor of my grandfather and father's naval service. I initially learned to sail in Puerto Rico as a teenager and began my ASA certification in Lake Travis near Austin, TX. I'm excited to be out of the deserts of New Mexico and back near the ocean so I can do some more sailing!</p>
	
	<h2>Science Fiction / Fantasy</h2>
	<p><img class="icon" src="img/star-trek.png">Do you know that <span class="lotr">Lin</span> means melody in High Elvish? Do you refer to multiple Star Trek episodes by their official names such as 'The Best of Both Worlds?' When you hear the word Taiga do you think of a Magic the Gathering dual land? Do you know that Mace Windu had a purple lightsaber because Samuel Jackson personally requested it from George Lucas? Welcome to my world ;)</p>
