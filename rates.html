	<h1>RATES</h1>

	<p><span class="drop-cap">H</span>ave you been bamboozled in the past by developers who either don't deliver or who have poor communication skills? If I'm brought on a project, you get not only a strong, competent developer, but also a single point of contact that collaborates professionally. At this time I specialize in mobile apps including native iOS and Android apps as well as web development of nearly any kind including integration.</p>

	<p>There are two ways you can hire me &mdash; at a fixed price or at an hourly rate. With either option, I work on a retainer basis. This means I bill a portion of the cost upfront and then work off the retainer.</p>
	
	<h2>Fixed Price</h2>
	<p>In this arrangement, which is my preference, there is a fixed price for the entire project; however, there is a prerequisite of requirements for the project in the form of complete <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe">wireframes</a>. If backend integration is needed, API documentation is needed as well.</p>
	
	<p>Upon receipt of the wireframes, I'm happy to provide a quote. An example fixed price contract for an iOS app totaling $850 is below.</p>
	
	<p class="contract"><a href="fixed-price-contract.pdf"><img src="img/pdf.png"><br>fixed-price-contract.pdf</a></p>
	
	<h2>Hourly Rate</h2>
	<p>In this arrangement, I can be engaged on a project at a maximum of 20 hours per week at a rate of $55 / hour. An example hourly rate contract for the same iOS app is below.</p>

	<p>You can reach me at <a href="mailto:contact@robertpeterson.io">contact@robertpeterson.io</a> or 575-224-0080 to request my availability or a quote.</p>
