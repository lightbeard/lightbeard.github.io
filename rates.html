	<h1>RATES</h1>

	<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span>f I'm brought on your team, you not only get an experience IT and business professional, but you will have a resource that cultivates growth and harmony in an organization.</p>

	<p>There are two ways you can hire me &mdash; at a fixed price or at an hourly rate. With either option, I work on a retainer basis and a statement of work is agreed upon. This means I bill a portion of the cost upfront and then work off the retainer. Travel expenses are included in the retainer.</p>
	
	<h2>Fixed Price</h2>
	<p>In this arrangement, which is my preference, there is a fixed price for the entire project. If it is a small project, half of the total cost is paid upfront and the second half at project completion.</p>
	
	<p>Upon receipt of requirements, I am happy to provide a quote. An example fixed price statement of work for a project totaling $5,000 is below.</p>

	<h2>Hourly Rate</h2>
	<p>In this arrangement, I can be engaged on a project at a maximum of 40 hours per week at a rate of $75 / hour. An example hourly rate contract for the same project is below.</p>
