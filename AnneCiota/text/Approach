<p>My role is as your guide and facilitator in helping you clear limiting beliefs and trapped emotional energy so that you may more fully embody the truth of who you are.  The main techniques I use are listed below .  However, I often incorporate other techniques as well.</p>
<p><b>EFT/Meridian Tapping – Emotional Freedom Technique</b> EFT, or Tapping, has been called psychological acupuncture without needles. While tapping on certain acupuncture points with your fingertips,  you  focus on a negative emotion or distressing thought.   Research has  shown that this  shifts brain patterns that lead to unwanted thoughts, actions and emotions.  It is a terrific self-help tool, and most of my clients would heartily agree with this.  EFT/tapping has been used worldwide to relieve emotional and physical issues.</p>
<p><b>TAT – Tapas Acupressure Technique</b> Developed by acupuncturist Tapas Fleming, TAT is an effective process that helps resolve stress and trauma.  No needles involved – you simply gently touch  certain acupuncture points  in the TAT pose while I guide you through the process.  Tapas writes, “TAT helps to heal the emotional causes of trauma, physical illnesses, phobias, negative beliefs and negative patterns.  TAT is also a tool you can actively use to create the life you want to live now.”</p>
<p><b>Emotion Code</b> The Emotion Code is an energy healing technique that helps us to identify and literally release trapped emotions – which are harmful emotional energies from negative past events.  Trapped emotions can cause depression and anxiety.  They can block people from love and happiness and make them feel disconnected from others. Because trapped emotions are made of energy, just like the rest of the body, they exert an influence on the physical tissues, and can cause acute pain and even cancer.  Releasing trapped emotions makes conditions right for the body to heal – so physical and emotional difficulties often disappear or become much more manageable.  ~ Dr. Brad Nelson</p>
<p><b>Gentle Reprocessing Gentle</b> Reprocessing integrates guided imagery, EMDR components, inner child work, and cognitive therapy.  It reduces symptoms of PTSD, Anxiety, Depression and abuse.</p>
<p><b>Heart Rhythm Meditation</b> There are many types of meditation.  During Heart Rhythm Meditation, a heart-centered practice, you learn to coordinate your breath with your heartbeat.  It is another great tool for de-stressing.</p>
