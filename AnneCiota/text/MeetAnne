I have over 30 years of experience as a warm, compassionate therapist and over 20 years as an energy psychology practitioner. I have excellent results with clients who are willing to accept responsibility for their lives and do not see themselves as victims.</p>
<p>I am a certified Personal Development and Accountability Coach through Achieve Today. I am also certified in several powerful energy psychology techniques, including EFT or Tapping, TAT (Tapas Acupressure Technique) and the Emotion Code, and trained in Matrix Reimprinting, Heart Rhythm Meditation and Mindfulness practices.</p>
