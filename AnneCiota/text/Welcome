<p>Welcome! If you are reading this, then I am fairly certain that you want to change something in your life &mdash; and you have not been able to do so. I imagine you are not feeling as free or as happy and fulfilled as you would like. Perhaps even feeling stuck or trapped, or downright depressed or anxious. Feeling frustrated and discouraged at the very least. Perhaps you are even mad at yourself for being the way you are.</p>
<p>I believe there is a primary reason for this: You are not living your truth! You are not <i>embodying your truth</i>. If you were, you would feel happier and freer, enjoying your life rather than struggling and dealing with “issues”. It might mean mastering anxiety and depression, dealing with stress, healing phobias, stopping emotional overeating, ending procrastination, eradicating poor self-esteem, healing trauma, improving relationships, etc.  The truth is that freedom and happiness are your divine birthright. But it’s impossible to embody your truth when your mind is filled with “ junk”. Our subconscious minds “run the show” with this junk, which consists of subconscious beliefs about yourself. Some of the most common beliefs are : “I don’t deserve”, “I’m not good enough”, “It’s not safe,” and “It’s not possible.” We all grow up with these kinds of beliefs and we live our lives as if they were true. It’s literally letting a younger you run your life!</p>
