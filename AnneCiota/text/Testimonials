<p>~  “Anne has a special gift of being able to tune into you like a laser, and get to the root of the problem quickly.  Her holistic approach is tailored uniquely to the client and is filled with powerful but simple and gentle healing techniques.  I have made great progress with each session, unlike conventional talk therapy that takes months and years to even begin to uncover the true issue.  I have tremendous appreciation for Anne whose intuitiveness and sensitivity have given me the tools to live each day in hopefulness, clarity and happiness.  I’m living life as I always wanted – with peace and joy, energy and excitement for the future.” – With great appreciation, Laura</p>
<p>~  “It is great to have met you and I deeply appreciate the work we did together.  I was looking for something to “move me off the spot” in terms of addressing and releasing some emotional baggage.  I truly wanted to better understand my thinking, motives and the “why” of my behaviors.  To see if there were patterns for me that I thought were protecting me, but in fact were actually inhibiting growth.  Traditional talk therapy alone had not worked for me in the past.  Your approach, which includes other alternative modalities like EFT, TAT and the Emotion Code was exactly what I needed.  It was interesting and I saw results immediately.  It also allowed me to take away tools to use on my own.  Every week I left feeling wonderful, with a gift of insight and a practice for my continued exploration of me.  Thank you for being part of my journey of self discovery.” – Nancy, New Hampshire</p>
<p>~  “Anne is an incredibly giving and nurturing person.  She helped me through a very difficult period in my life.  She is intuitive and insightful.  I have grown so much since beginning my work with her.  She has taught me so much about myself but, more importantly, she has given me tools to be able to heal emotionally from the hurts in my life.  I now feel like I have the ongoing ability to deal with the  challenges in my life.” – P.F., Massachusetts</p>
<p>~  “Using The Emotion Code has been, literally, transformational for me.  In my first session of the Emotion Code, anxiety and stress melted away effortlessly.  I was astounded that healing could occur so gently and so quickly.  In place of the endless “Blah, Blah, Blah” sessions of talk therapy, the Emotion Code brought me relief in one session.  Additional Emotion Code sessions have lifted depression, swept away grief, and erased fear.  I am experiencing happiness, improved health and, for the first time in a very long time, I look forward to each day with joyful anticipation.” – Anne, age 59</p>
<p>~  “I really felt better.  I was thinking with a lot more clarity.  It enabled me to know myself better and gave me a sense of well-being.” – J.K., age 50</p>
<p>~  “I am so thankful for the compassion, care, generosity, support, kindness and understanding you have shown me.  You helped me through much of the darkness, despair and hopelessness that once consumed my life, and always gave me the needed encouragement and hope that healing was and  is possible!!   I have learned so much from you, in terms of using countless healing methods and tools to heal and empower myself.” – Nina, age 25</p>
<p>~  “Tapas Acupressure Therapy (TAT) is like a breath of fresh air.  I appreciate the gentle ease of the technique.  I am in awe of the instantaneous effectiveness of TAT.   A lifetime of trauma is melting away without having to relive the trauma and without having to talk endlessly about an incident.  With each session I emerge more joyful and I feel a strong, fresh renewal of self.  My life has changed dramatically in a positive direction.  I have experienced relief from depression and grief.  . . .  I feel a freedom and excitement for life that I haven’t felt since I was a child.” – Diane, New Hampshire</p>
<p>~  “Working with Anne was very helpful.  In very quick fashion she helped me resolve an important and key issue.  This is something I have tried to work on for a long time.  I have no emotional charge around this now and feel this frees me up for moving on in many areas of my life.” – Connie in Connecticut</p>
<p>~  “The work with Anne using the Emotion Code was profound and deeply healing.  I highly recommend her and this technique.” – Sue, age 45</p>
<p>~  “The SRT session that I had brought me at peace within myself.  It let me find out how negative patterns develop from past lives and transfer to the present.  Not only did Anne find the roots of these patterns, but she also cleared them.  Once a clearing began I felt as if I were standing under a cool fresh waterfall that washed all those negative blocks away from my LIFE and SOUL.  Thanks to SRT and Anne I am able to live freer because the blocks that once deterred me from success and happiness are no longer there.” – J.T., Massachusetts</p>
