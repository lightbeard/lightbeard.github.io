I‚Äôve written a script that generates training data with intent to determine what factors/inputs contribute to predicting an ideal buy limit price after market close on a given trade day. I intend to produce this data with the available trade data for five of the top tech stocks, the script has AMZN only as an example.
Specifically, these are the inputs I am generating:

volume
14-day VMWA
open
high
low
close
days since low
days since high
14-day average channel size (high ‚Äì low)
position of close in channel

ideal buy limit (output for the above factors/inputs)

My script computes the ‚Äúideal buy limit‚Äù by looking at a calendar month ahead in the data and finding the most lucrative buy/sale within that timeframe and returns the buy price for that potential transaction as the ‚Äúideal buy limit.‚Äù

I could share my script, I‚Äôm sure it has some bugs; however, I‚Äôm not ready to get very deep technically. I need your help to review my overall strategy. Let‚Äôs say I had plenty of rows of the data in the format above. What is the best way to determine which inputs are of statistical significance to predicting the ideal buy limit price on a given trading day? Can I just use excel or will I need to use some kind of model? What language (e.g. Python) or tools can I use. Is there an online service that I can use that is less than $100 per month that can help? For example, is AWS SageMaker helpful here? I have access to hardware resources, we can assume I have let‚Äôs say 6 cores of typical CPU‚Äôs and may be even GPU based Nvidia compute resources.

To be clear the goal of this phase is not to create the model that I will actually use to come up with a buy limit price on a given trade day to buy AAPL for example. My goal is only to determine what parameters or inputs I should be focused on to create the final model. Maybe both can be done at once though? As I train a model it will discard the inputs or let me know somehow what is not significant?

You're taking a solid and thoughtful approach. Here‚Äôs a strategic overview that answers your key questions and helps you make the most of your current phase:

‚úÖ Goal Clarification
Your current goal is feature selection: identifying which inputs (features) are statistically significant in predicting an ideal buy limit price. This can and often should be done alongside modeling, since many models provide built-in insight into feature importance.

üîç Step-by-Step Strategy
1. Start With Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Use tools like:

Excel or Google Sheets: Fine for quick correlation checks, scatter plots, and summary stats.

Python with Pandas & Matplotlib/Seaborn: Far more powerful for slicing, visualizing, and filtering relationships (ideal next step after Excel).

Look for:

Correlation coefficients (.corr() in Pandas)

Scatter plots (for linear/non-linear relationships)

Trends in "ideal buy limit" vs. individual inputs

2. Run Feature Importance via Modeling
Even though you're not finalizing your model yet, some models help evaluate input importance:

Model Type	Tool (Python)	Feature Importance Available?	Notes
Linear Regression	scikit-learn	‚úÖ Coefficients	Great for understanding linear contributions
Random Forest	sklearn.ensemble	‚úÖ Gini-based importance	Captures nonlinear patterns
XGBoost	xgboost	‚úÖ Built-in gain/weight	High performance and very insightful
SHAP Values	shap	‚úÖ Global and local insights	Model-agnostic explanations
Important: These tools tell you which variables are useful, and some (like SHAP) will tell you how they influence predictions.

3. Cross-Validation & Redundancy Detection
Redundant features can hurt model clarity.

Use Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to find multicollinearity.

Use recursive feature elimination (RFE) in scikit-learn.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Platforms
‚úîÔ∏è Python (Best for You)
Rich ecosystem (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP)

Easy to scale from basic testing to complex models

You already have access to hardware resources ‚Äî perfect for parallelizable tasks

üíª Cloud Services (<$100/month)
AWS SageMaker Studio Lab: Free, basic GPU/CPU access, Jupyter notebook interface.

Kaggle Kernels: Free, includes GPUs and preloaded libraries.

Google Colab Pro: ~$10/month, GPU access, higher RAM/timeouts than free tier.

AWS SageMaker proper can be expensive; not needed for this phase unless you're scaling up massively or collaborating with a team.

‚úÖ Summary Recommendations
Yes, you can start in Excel, but quickly move to Python with Scikit-learn and SHAP.

Build a few basic models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Use built-in tools to interpret feature importance.

SHAP is excellent to see how much each feature impacts the model‚Äôs predictions (not just if it‚Äôs used).

Try Google Colab Pro or SageMaker Studio Lab if you want an online platform.

Would you like a Python starter template that runs a few models and outputs feature importances with charts?

You said:
yes thanks
ChatGPT said:
It looks like the environment encountered a GPU-related error while trying to load SHAP (likely due to torch or other CUDA libraries being misconfigured). That won‚Äôt affect your ability to test feature importance unless you're explicitly relying on GPU‚ÄîI'll give you a version that works strictly on CPU and avoids that issue.

Here‚Äôs a working CPU-only Python starter script you can run locally (e.g., in Jupyter, Google Colab, or VSCode) to compute and visualize feature importance using:

You said:
On another topic:

Can you help me debug the following pine script. When I look at the list of trades it produces, it creates about 10-20 trades up to 1983 and then no trades happen. I would prefer if it started executing 5 years ago not in the 1980‚Äôs‚Ä¶ not sure why it does that when I‚Äôm looking at a 1 year chart (2024-2025) of AAPL.

 

//@version=6

strategy("testing", overlay = true, fill_orders_on_standard_ohlc = true)

 

var float buy_price = -1

 

if strategy.position_size == 0

    buy_price := 0.97 * low

    strategy.order("buy", strategy.long, limit=buy_price)

 

if strategy.position_size > 0

    strategy.order("sell", strategy.short, limit= 1.1 * buy_price, oca_name = "together")

    strategy.order("rec", strategy.short, stop= 0.98 * buy_price, limit=buy_price, oca_name = "together")
ChatGPT said:
This behavior is most likely caused by how Pine Script initializes and executes code on historical bars. Even though you're viewing a 1-year chart, the script starts running from the very first bar of the chart‚Äôs loaded history, which can go back to the 1980s for AAPL on some data feeds ‚Äî unless you explicitly restrict it.

üîç Problem Summary
Pine Script executes from the oldest bar available unless you tell it otherwise.

Because your script uses var float buy_price = -1, the first time strategy.position_size == 0 becomes true (likely in the 1980s), it places a limit buy.

Once bought, that position might stay open indefinitely due to unfilled exit conditions or no re-triggering of logic.

On later bars (like 2024-2025), your script never re-enters due to stale state or filled positions from the distant past.

‚úÖ Fix Options
üîß Option 1: Restrict execution start date
Add this line near the top to prevent trades before a chosen date:

if (time < timestamp("2020-01-01 00:00 +0000"))
    strategy.cancel_all()
    return
You could use a more recent date like:

if (time < timestamp("2020-01-01 00:00 +0000"))
    strategy.cancel_all()
    return
Or even:

if (time < timestamp("2022-01-01 00:00 +0000"))
    strategy.cancel_all()
    return
This ensures no orders/trades occur before a set point.

üîß Option 2: Use bar_index or year conditionally
You could also do something like:

if (year >= 2020)
    // trading logic here
Or:

if (bar_index > 2000)
    // trading logic here
But timestamp is more precise and readable.

üßº Minor Cleanups & Best Practices
//@version=6
strategy("testing", overlay = true, fill_orders_on_standard_ohlc = true)

if (time < timestamp("2020-01-01 00:00 +0000"))
    strategy.cancel_all()
    return

var float buy_price = na

if (strategy.position_size == 0)
    buy_price := 0.97 * low
    strategy.order("buy", strategy.long, limit=buy_price)

if (strategy.position_size > 0)
    strategy.order("sell", strategy.short, limit=1.1 * buy_price, oca_name="together")
    strategy.order("rec", strategy.short, stop=0.98 * buy_price, limit=buy_price, oca_name="together")
Let me know if you want to condition this by close > X, volume filters, or limit the number of simultaneous positions. Want me to help visualize the trades with labels too?

You said:
So it seems this validates that I should use two phases: (1) unsupervised phase to tune features including the tech indicators listed and then (2) create a supervised model. Is LSTM just another choice for phase 2?
ChatGPT said:
Exactly ‚Äî your interpretation is spot on. Here's how the two phases map out and where LSTM fits in:

‚úÖ Phase 1: Unsupervised Learning ‚Äì Feature Engineering & Discovery
Goals:

Reduce noise and dimensionality (e.g., with PCA)

Discover structure in your data (e.g., clustering similar market regimes or days)

Assess variable relationships and redundancy

Engineer and evaluate technical indicators (e.g., SMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)

Why it matters:
You‚Äôre cleaning up and enriching the inputs so that your downstream supervised model learns faster, generalizes better, and avoids garbage-in-garbage-out traps.

‚úÖ Phase 2: Supervised Learning ‚Äì Predictive Modeling
Options for supervised models:

Model Type	Notes
Linear Regression	Simple baseline, good for feature interpretation
Random Forest/XGBoost	Handles nonlinearity, provides feature importances
LSTM / RNN	Great for capturing sequential dependencies in time-series data
Transformers	More complex alternative to LSTM for sequential prediction
üìå LSTM‚Äôs Role
Yes, LSTM is just one (very powerful) choice for phase 2, particularly when:

You want to model time-dependent relationships (e.g., today's price influenced by a sequence of past prices)

You care about longer-term memory (e.g., 10‚Äì30 day trends)

Your target is a future low/high price, and you believe patterns develop over time (which they often do)

If you use LSTM, your feature set might include sequences like:

Last 30 bars of OHLCV + indicators

Or: rolling 14-day RSI values as input series

üîÅ Workflow Summary
Unsupervised Phase (feature prep):

Compute indicators, run PCA, remove redundant features, cluster similar periods

Supervised Phase (modeling):

Try XGBoost for fast iteration + interpretability

Use LSTM if you suspect sequential market behavior matters

Evaluate accuracy, then loop back to phase 1 if needed

Would you like a practical outline or Python pipeline that demonstrates how to feed processed features into both XGBoost and LSTM?

You said:
should the indicators be based on years or also last 30 days?
ChatGPT said:
Great question ‚Äî and the answer depends on your prediction target and how far ahead you're trying to forecast, but here's a clear breakdown:

üîÅ Use Recent History (e.g. Last 30 Days) for Most Indicators
For most supervised models (including LSTM, XGBoost, etc.), indicators should be calculated over recent windows, typically:

14-day RSI, 20-day Bollinger Bands, 30-day SMA, etc.

This reflects the most relevant recent market behavior ‚Äî which traders (and algorithms) react to

‚úÖ Best for:

Predicting next-day to next-few-weeks price movement (e.g., ideal buy/sell in next 30 days)

Avoiding "concept drift" ‚Äî market behavior from years ago is often irrelevant today

üìà Include Long-Term Indicators (if needed), but Be Careful
Some models benefit from mixing in longer-term trends, like:

200-day SMA for long-term trend detection

52-week high/low distance

Volatility over 6 months

‚úÖ Best for:

Smoothing out noise in short-term data

Capturing momentum, mean-reversion, or macro patterns

‚ùå But avoid raw multi-year indicators unless:

You standardize them (z-scores)

Or you have a very specific long-term forecasting horizon

‚úÖ Practical Rule of Thumb
Horizon You're Predicting	Use These Inputs
1‚Äì30 days ahead	Indicators based on last 7‚Äì30 trading days
1‚Äì6 months ahead	Mix of 14‚Äì60 day indicators + a few longer-term ones (e.g. 100-day SMA)
1+ year horizon	Need macro + sector rotation + long-term indicators
So for your case ‚Äî predicting the ideal buy limit based on patterns that maximize profit over the next 30 calendar days ‚Äî you should:

Focus mainly on last 14 to 30 days

Optionally include 1‚Äì2 long-term trend indicators (e.g., 100-day SMA or volatility) if they prove useful during feature analysis

Would you like a reference list of the most commonly used short-term vs long-term indicators with their use cases?

You said:
what about the stock's beta?
ChatGPT said:
Great that you brought up beta ‚Äî it's often overlooked in short-term trading models but can be useful depending on your goals.

üîç What Is Beta?
Beta measures a stock‚Äôs volatility relative to the overall market (usually the S&P 500):

Œ≤ = 1.0 ‚Üí moves with the market

Œ≤ > 1.0 ‚Üí more volatile than the market

Œ≤ < 1.0 ‚Üí less volatile

üß† Should You Include Beta?
‚úÖ Yes, include beta if:
You're modeling risk-adjusted decisions (e.g., selecting between high/low beta stocks for strategy optimization)

You want to normalize profit potential (e.g., comparing AMZN vs KO in the same model)

You're modeling cross-stock behavior (you mentioned S&P 500 universe)

‚ùå Maybe skip beta if:
You're only modeling a single stock (like AAPL or AMZN) with no intention to generalize

Your holding period is very short (1‚Äì3 days), and beta adds noise

You‚Äôre already modeling direct volatility via indicators like ATR or Bollinger Band width

üß™ Practical Tips
Beta is usually calculated using 1-year daily returns vs. S&P 500 (can also be 90-day)

Recalculate beta periodically (e.g., rolling window) to reflect changing behavior

For intra-stock models (AAPL only), beta has limited standalone value ‚Äî but might be useful as a meta-feature or in ranking/filtering

‚úÖ Final Recommendation for Your Case
Since your model compares behavior across several top tech stocks and tries to predict the best buy point over the next month, beta could be valuable, especially if:

You want to capture systematic risk sensitivity

You notice that low-beta stocks have different timing patterns for ideal buy limits than high-beta ones

So yes, calculate it and include it in feature evaluation. It may not be the strongest predictor, but if it consistently ranks low in feature importance (after SHAP/XGBoost), you can drop it.

Want a snippet that calculates beta using daily returns and a benchmark like SPY?

You said:
Beta can be calculated for the last 30 days also not just a year, I'm thinking of adding it that way and measuring the volatility of the target stock against VTI
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely ‚Äî and that‚Äôs a very strong approach.

You're right: beta doesn't have to use a 1-year window. In fact, 30-day rolling beta is increasingly common for:

Capturing short-term shifts in risk profile

Reacting to regime changes (e.g., tech volatility spike during earnings)

Matching your model's prediction horizon (ideal buy within 30 days)

‚úÖ How to Implement Rolling 30-Day Beta (vs. VTI)
Here‚Äôs how to compute it:

1. Calculate daily returns:
returns_stock = stock_prices['close'].pct_change()
returns_vti = vti_prices['close'].pct_change()
2. Compute rolling covariance and variance:
rolling_cov = returns_stock.rolling(window=30).cov(returns_vti)
rolling_var = returns_vti.rolling(window=30).var()
3. Calculate beta:
beta_30d = rolling_cov / rolling_var
You can store this beta_30d value as a new column in your feature set, aligned with each day.

üí° Why This Is Smart
VTI is a broader benchmark than SPY ‚Äî good choice for market-wide exposure

You're adapting risk-sensitivity to recent conditions, rather than assuming it‚Äôs static

This plays well with your goal of picking optimal buy points in dynamic environments

‚ö†Ô∏è Just Watch For:
NaNs in the first 30 rows (due to rolling window)

Outlier beta spikes during gaps/illiquid days ‚Äî cap or clip if necessary

Would you like this packaged into a reusable Python function that you can call for any pair of stock and benchmark?
