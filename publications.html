	<p><span class="drop-cap">Technical</span> writing is a significant part of my experience in the IT industry. Below is an incomplete list of publications I've authored.</p>

	<p>I'm currently in transition from living at the Lama Foundation in northern New Mexico where I served as maintainer of its 100% off-the-grid Solar System. I'm moving to the central Massachussetts area to be closer to extended family since my fianc&eacute;e and I are expecting!</p>

	<p>I am available for freelance projects such as development of iOS/Android applications or development of CMS-based sites given clear requiremenets with wireframes. I'm also interested in part-time IT positions or part-time technical writing such as IT Documentation.</p>
