	<p><span class="drop-cap"><img class="headshot" src="img/guidance-friendship.png"></span>Hello, I'm Robert Ross Pe­ter­son. I earned my stripes at IBM where as a highly specialized enterprise consultant, I spent time with IBM's finest leadership including former CEO, Sam Palmisano. With a reputation as an IT Red Adair, I have consulted for numerous market leading companies and government agencies internationally. If you bank with a major financial institution in the US or Europe it is more likely than not, that I've conducted business with them either to advise on highly complex integration problems, to strengthen relationships, or to showcase cutting-edge technology.</p>

	<p>Do you have an IT product or service that you are struggling to take to market? Perhaps you are in a situation where releases are consistently late or disconnected from business needs and the moral of IT staff is low? Perhaps the organization needs to grow and mature so more products or services are released, but adding staff seems to reduce productivity? Another common situation with IT is key energetic figures that held the organization together when it was smaller are either gone or overtaxed with the organization's current size and scope. Perhaps you simply seek experienced consultation in IT management or strategy</p>
	
	<p>These are the types of situations that truly test an IT organization. With a strong consulting background both from a technology and business perspective, my leadership style is to observe an organization and identify initiatives that are inhibiting the organization from thriving. Based on my experience seeing first-hand how industry giants perform IT, strategy, management, sales, and marketing — my approach is to look for untapped potential in an organization where an initiative will bring the most value and results.</p>

	<p>I'm a firm believer in measurement or key performance indicators because the facts cut through opinions and politics. For instance, if an organization is missing a consistent marketing message for market differentiation, this may be a potential initiative. However, what I consider to be far more important is quantifying the effect of the change and proving the impact of the initiative.</p>

	<p>I've always had a love for technology which is reflected in my works as an author, speaker, and inventor. I have 56 granted patents, I've published several books, and I'm a frequent conference speaker.</p>
