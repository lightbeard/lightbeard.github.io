	<p><span class="drop-cap"><img class="headshot" src="img/guidance-friendship.png"></span>Hello, I'm Robert Ross Peterson &mdash; an experienced meditation instructor, IT manager, consultant, inventor, and author.</p>

	<p>I have over four years of experience teaching meditation. I specialize in applied meditation &mdash; realization of our deepest purpose and desires, but also the practice of bringing these potentials into the physical world. I spent the past year at the Lama Foundation as a resident teacher and manager of winter programs. I hold a Master of Meditation from the Institute for Applied Meditation.</p>

	<p>In the IT world, I earned my stripes at IBM, experienced startup life by founding Parseix, excelled in management at the Texas health department, and today I have passion for helping organizations thrive that value interconnectedness, sustainability and altruism. I hold a MS in Computer Engineering.</p>
	
	<p>I am open to full-time positions if I am in alignment with the culture of the organization and travel requirements are 50% or below.</p>
