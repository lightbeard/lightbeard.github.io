	<p><span class="drop-cap">H</span>ello! I'm Robert Ross Peterson and this is my semi-professional informational site. I'm an award winning Inventor, Author, and Computer Engineer with over 12 years of IT experience. Lately my interests have been in iPhone development and C++ although I have experience in a wide array of technology from robotics to Javascript to PHP.</p>

	<p>I'm currently in transition from living at the Lama Foundation in northern New Mexico where I served as maintainer of its 100% off-the-grid Solar System. I'm moving to the central Massachussetts area to be closer to extended family since my fianc&eacute;e and I are expecting!</p>

	<p>I am available for freelance projects such as development of iOS/Android applications or development of CMS-based sites given clear requiremenets with wireframes. I'm also interested in part-time IT positions or part-time technical writing such as IT Documentation.</p>
