    <h2 id="meet">Meet Robert</h2>
    <p><img class="img-padding" src="img/guidance-friendship.png">Hi, I'm Robert and welcome to my informational site. I earned my stripes at IBM professional services where I consulted for enterprise applications at Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Scotland, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, and the like. I later took an architecture position with Tivoli formerly IBM's security and monitoring software arm.</p>
    <p>After IBM, I co-founded a Monitoring as a Service (MaaS) startup called Parseix. I was also a key figure in the security architecture and operations of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), at state and federal levels, during my tenure at the Health and Human Services Commission. Today I'm happily employed by MassMutual.</p>
    <p>I'm co-author of <a href="publications.html">Persistence in the Enterprise</a>, inventor of fifty-eight technology patents, have presented at numerous conferences, and hold a MS in Computer Engineering.</p>
    <p>Believe it or not, I am half Honduran and speak fluent Spanish. Although my father is Scottish and Swedish, my mother is from Honduras. My father met my mother in Tegucigalpa while he was in the Peace Corps where she was working as an executive secretary for the Honduran Department of Health. They fell in love, moved back to the US, and I was born in New Jersey.</p>
<p>I grew up with Central American food such as refried red beans, hand-made corn tortillas (totally unlike store bought), Baleadas, Pupusas, and other dishes "Catrachos."</p>
<p>My father was an officer in the Navy so I grew up traveling every 1&ndash;2 years to port cities on the east and west coast, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and southern Spain where I went to High School.</p>
<p>My career has mirrored my youth in terms of a lot of overseas projects. Some of my favorite "gigs" or consulting projects have been in Edinburgh, Sydney, and Istanbul for example.</p>
    <p>Today I live in Hadley, Massachusetts with my family. We have a rambunctious 1-year old boy <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>
